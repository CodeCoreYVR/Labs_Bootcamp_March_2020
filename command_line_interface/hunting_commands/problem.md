This lab is a hunt for a variety of shell commands. To solve these, use the
developer's most powerful tool: Google.

**Write down all commands you've found.** You may be asked to share your
solutions during the lab. Try out all the commands you find!

1. Find a command to list the commands that you have used recently.
2. Find a command to delete a file. Try it on a file that you've created with
   `touch`.
3. Find out how to delete a directory with the command you found in **2.**
4. Find a command to search for files and/or directories by their names.
5. Find a command to list all active running programs (i.e. processes) like your
   OS' Activity Monitor.

## Stretch

1. Find a command to download files from the internet.
2. Find a command to search for text inside of files. How can you search files
   within directories recursively?
