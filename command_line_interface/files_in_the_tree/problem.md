This lab uses the directories created in **A Tree of Directories**.

Using `nano` create 3 files containing at least 3 lines of text. Name them:

- `memoir.txt`
- `agenda.txt`
- `calendar.txt`

Using `cat` and a redirection operator _(i.e. `>` or `>>`)_, create another file
from the contents of the 3 files created in the previous step, named:
`compilation.txt`. It should contain all of the text inside of `memoir.txt`,
`agenda.txt` and `calendar.txt`.

Using `mv`, move `memoir.txt` inside the `gertrude_styles` directory. Then, move
`agenda.txt` inside the `lola_tul` directory. Then, move `calendar.txt` to the
`emma_styles_grim` directory.

Using `cp`, copy `memoir.txt` from `gertrude_styles` to the `herve_tul`
directory. Again using `cp`, copy the `herve_tul` directory to `bob_styles`
renaming it to `herve_styles`.
